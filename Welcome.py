         CLOT WATCH was developed as an academic project by seniors at Northeastern University in collaboration with
         Dr. Anahita Dua and her team at Massachusetts General Hospital. CLOT WATCH has been minimally tested and has
         not been reviewed by the FDA. It should not be used to definitively assume a patient's risk of thrombosis.
         There are many factors that may play into a patient's risk of thrombosis, and CLOT WATCH does not take all of
         them into account. Physicians should use their own judgement and analysis of the patient in addition to, or
         even in place of, the risk evaluation produced by CLOT WATCH.]
